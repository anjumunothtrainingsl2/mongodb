election process
N2 primary
Once n1 -- up -- secondary 

Election Take place:1
1. Set up my replica set
2. When primary down
3. Change the config of replica set

Node in replica set -- 
Priority(0 to any integer value), 
Vote - Yes, No

Replica set --- 50 nodes;(7 are eligible to vote)
Priority - 0 ; cannot become a primary
priority - 1,2, 3, 4


7 node structure 
Election Process
1. Sec node which has the highest priority(non zero)
2. Which has been a primary earlier
3. replication lag (synched with the primary latest)
4. Round robin

2sec heartbeat exchange
10 sec - no heartbeat -- that node is down
If primary is down -- election -- 12 sec 

22 sec -- max a write op may fail

Secondary nodes:
1. Normal sec node
2. Zero priority sec node -- cannot be primary  
-- read (frequent scale ups and scale downs)
-- reduce the number of participants in the election
-- node in a particular location which should never become a primary

4. Hidden member  -- not visible to the app(no writes , no reads)
-- Priority -- 0
-- vote -- yes/no
-- sec member -- replication-- sync from the primary
-- Backup; 

5. Delayed member 
sync with the primary after a delay(sec) slaveDelay:
-- priority -- 0
-- vote  -- yes/no
-- DR; rollback is not there in mongodb 
-- chainingAllowed -- true 
	node can sync with another fully synced sec also

max retention period -- 12 hours
